          As a Clan we have pulled together a set of principles and good practices which we use for Interaction Design
          to provide consistency and guidance to how we apply design rationale and practices leading to improved
          interaction design and a
          better user experience.

              User needs come in different forms; designing for
              information-based and task-based needs will lead to services which allow users to accomplish their tasks
              while designing for behaviour-based needs improves the experience as it will have been designed for how
              they
              use the service and avoids 'fudges' and workarounds.
